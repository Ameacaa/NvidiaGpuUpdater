### Download the latests driver for your gpu without Geforce Experience

### Requirement:
- Selenium Chrome - May change in future update because it's not the best way but I need time for it

### How it works:
- Open NVIDIA drivers pages and with the dropboxes it selects your gpu, then click "Search"
- In the new page. Check the avaliable driver version with your current driver version.
- Download the latest driver if exists

### Future Updates (Wanted):
- Use something else than selenium (take to much time and have more problems in time)
- Better way to choose your gpu
