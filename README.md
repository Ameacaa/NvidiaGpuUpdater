## Nvidia GPU Updater
Download the latest GPU driver without relying on GeForce Experience. 

#### Why I don't like Geforce Experience:
- Resource Consumption: GeForce Experience runs in the background and consumes CPU and memory unnecessarely.
- Bloatware: Unnecessary software. You don't need it to have the latest driver version.
- Privacy: Need account, why? And it collects some data about the system and game habits, maybe more.

#### Future Updates:
- Implement a more user-friendly method for selecting your GPU.
- Create an executable
